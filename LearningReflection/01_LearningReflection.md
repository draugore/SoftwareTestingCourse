> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- This kind of manual seting requires a lot of work and attention to detail. Sometimes I wasn't sure what I was about to do, especially when teh issue page was on, I had never used it before and had to idea what to do. 
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I was testing the app, checking what happens when I do stuff and 'if I click this what happens' kind of familiarizing msyelf with it. What comes to the test cases, I was relying on the instructions and the videos attached to Canvas learning materials. Trying to copy the way they used the test cases in the videos, trying to make them as simple as possible. 
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     I do not really know which tools could be the best, but even though I really hate Excel I can kind of see how it would be useful in keeping track on several test cases.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- Visual Studio or Sublime Text.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-Working on the Issues-page test cases was the most difficult to do as I had no experience about it what so ever. But slowly familiarizing the environment helped, I guess!


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-I have used GitHub before no few coding courses but I must admit I haven't used that much and last time I opened the app was a loooong time ago. It takes some getting used to it when you're not so familiar with it. I'm still a bit scared of the whole consept of it but trying my best to get better at using it. 
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- Maybe I'd go for Cypress or Robot Framework. 



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Experience in testing, knowledge of iOS and Android ecosystems, excellent communication skills, attention to detail and exceptional problem-solving skills, ability to multitask seem to be mentioned on quite many job listings.



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I have no idea about automating the tests, I would love to work on that as well as more hand on experience in testing would be nice to have. Soft skills as getting better at communication and not feeling bad when somebody critizises your work should also be on tjhe top of my list.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-This project gave some ideas of how the testing would be in real life. But I must say, I mostly felt like somebody just threw me into cold water and said from the beach 'now you should learn how to swim'. I had no idea what to do or where to start- even though I had read all the instructions, done all the modules on the course and watched the instructions videos on module 7. Little bit like sink or swim. I still do not know whether I would have actually sank to the sea bottom as I do not know if my test cases are that strong or on point or if they are too detailed or too vague. I'm really hoping to get some feedback from the teacher once they check our project works!
